## Name
My legal first name is Daniel, although Dan and Danny are commonly used nicknames that I support 100% (I usually refer to myself as "Dan" for simplicity). Other variants people have used include:
* foreign translation and diminutives (Danilo, Даня, etc.)
* epithets ("Dan the Man")
* referential phrases/neologism (Danny boy, Dandroid, etc.)
I appreciate wordplay and will respond to anything related to the original "Daniel."

## Background
### Personal
I was born and raised in Connecticut. I moved to Georgia in the summer of 2018 and have 0 complaints. I currently work at Georgia Tech as an application developer.

### Academic
I've hopped around schools almost as often as jobs, but I'm glad to be finishing the degree in C++ programming from WCC this semester.

### Personal Interests
1. Programming
2. Music
3. Linguistics
4. Philosophy
5. Travel
