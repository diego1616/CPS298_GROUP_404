Greetings, my name is Ambyr and I'm a Computer Science major.  I like napping more now than I used to and am enjoying bonding with my loved ones during quarantine.  My partner in life and I have been catching up on all of the Anime we would otherwise have not had time for, enjoy exercising, and playing chase with our doggo.  I'm trying my best to look at each day in the perspective of what I GET TO DO versus what I don't.
