Hello everyone!

This is just a simple introduction as part of assignment 1.  

About me:

My Name is Diego Perez, I am 36 years old, born and raised in Colombia. I emigrated to the USA at 19 looking for better education opportunities.  Things didn't go as planned, and I ended up joining the military. I left the active duty life at 24, with the goal of attaining a college degree in Electrical Engineering.... here I am 12 years later and I am still not done, but now pursuing Software Engineering instead. My current job relates to industrial lasers and CNC equipment. The goal of this degree is to further my career and open new doors.

I also have a wife and three kids ages 5, 3, and 1.  They are my life and becoming a father is the best thing that's ever happened to me.  I come from a big family myself and having three young kids bring a lot of good memories from my childhood and my three siblings.

Hobbies:

I have been fixing industrial equipment for as long as I can remember.  I started doing it since I was 14 years old, but it has taken a toll on me, and missed out on life as a consequence.  I always wanted to do fun things like motocross, scuba diving, or playing soccer at the tournament level, but never did any of it. In my thirties, I wish to reinvent myself and enjoy life a lot more.  I will be moving to Florida after my degree is done, then buy a boat to sail the Caribbean in my spare time, along with the family of course.

If I get more spare time, then I will be getting into making little robots for my kids to play, and hopefully teach them as well.

Thank you!

Diego.
