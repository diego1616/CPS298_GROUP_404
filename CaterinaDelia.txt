My name is Caterina but I go by Katie.  I am a non-traditional student; I was a teacher for a while and that didn’t work out, so I decided to go back to school.  I’m finishing up my associates this semester; this is my last class.  I’m hoping to start a career in database management soon.  I work full time in retail, so my time is limited and my schedule is sporadic, but I don’t have many other time commitments.    

I have two cats, and when I get video working, I’m sure you’ll see them.  I also have a fish tank close to my desk, so if the sound picks it up, let me know.

I’m not married and have no kids.  I live in Ypsi, but I’m from Macomb, MI.
